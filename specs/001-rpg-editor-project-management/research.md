## Testing Framework for Next.js

**Decision**: We will use Jest for unit and integration testing.

**Rationale**: Jest is the de facto standard for testing React applications and is officially supported by Next.js. It provides a comprehensive testing framework with features like mocking, assertions, and code coverage, which are essential for our TDD approach.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Vitest**: A newer testing framework that is gaining popularity. While it offers excellent performance, Jest is more mature and has a larger community and ecosystem, making it a safer choice for this project.
